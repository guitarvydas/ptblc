How does this get parsed?

```
00100101
```

I see that the first '00' is parsed as Abstraction.

'10' is parsed as arg 0.

I don't yet see how '0101' is parsed...

`00100101` is tokenized as `00 10 01 01`. The first two tokens create a valid closed form expression for the identity function. At that point, the program has been read, and the remaining input (`0101`) is treated as stdin for the program. On the other hand, if you were to say `00 01 10 10` (the little omega combinator or `Î» [0 0]`) what would happen is `Parse` would recurse upon encountering `01` which is `APP`. The recursed parse would read `10` which is `0` and then return. The original `Parse` call would then loop, looking for the second term in the application (like the Sith there's always two and only two)
