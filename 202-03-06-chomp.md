Imagine you have a list (or stack) of things and pretend that λ is pronounced chomp. Even though lambda in reality is simply just a function that always accepts exactly one argument (e.g. `function (x) { ... }` we’re going to compare it to eating food just for fun.

Now let’s start off simple with the identity function. Here’s how a Krivine machine works. Say our list of things is `λ0 x y z`. We see the lambda so we chomp the x. It’s eaten into a closure where it’s stored at slot 0. Then we get `0 y z`. We evaluate the 0. We pull x out of the closure and we arrive at `x y z`.

One cool thing worth noting about the iconoclastic definitions in SectorLambda is that the `if` statement is defined as the identity function `if = λ 0`. Since the behavior of `if` is kind of integral to way this language operates. Most people actually don’t even bother including `if` in their lambda expressions for that reason. Another way `if` could be defined is `λλλ [[2 1] 0]` which is kind of like a longer version of the identity function, but that’s a better exercise to think about once you’re done reading this comment, especially if you mess around with the `lambda.com -v` program.

So let’s move on to something more complicated than the identity function. Consider false which is `λλ0` by our definition. This expression chomps twice, so if our stream of things is `λλ0 x y z` then we chomp and the stream becomes `λ0 y z` and `0=x` is tucked away in a closure. Then we chomp again and the stream becomes `0 z` and `0=y` is tucked away in a new closure, which means we have to reindex or push down `0=x` to `1=x`. Now we need to evaluate `0 z`. Since 0 in de Bruijn indexing references the argument passed to the nearest enclosing function, we resurrect `y` so the stream becomes `y z`.

So what did `λλ0` accomplish? In summary, it transformed the stream of things that follows from `x y z` to being `y z`. It acted as a selector or predicate. It dropped the x and kept the y. So if false=λλ0, then surely true would be λλ1. True selects the first of the two things that follow in the stream, so it would transform `x y z` into `x z`.

In any case, this selection behavior is the basis for logic the language. It lets us divide and conquer and that’s really all you need to start building your coding empire.

One thing you may be wondering is, why are the definitions of true and false backwards compared to C++? You’d expect false would come before true. One example of what makes this convention useful is the EOF behavior. For example, the NIL terminator is also defined as false. In the monadic I/O model, what NIL does is it skips ahead in the list of terms. In order to do that, it needs to hop over things until it eventually reaches an undefined term. That’s the point at which VM knows it needs to perform a read i/o operation, in order to “gro” the input list. It also allows us to determine program exit. It’s defined as a NIL selector skipping past the program image.

Ahh, yes...

brainstorming for discussion...

My "problem" is that I keep thinking that "true" and "false" are static pieces of data, when in fact, they are functions (which are data, too).  False is not 0, it is a function that returns its 0th arg[+].  Cond-then-else is a function (of 3 args, (expr, then, else)).  

[I haven't been following Forth, but this is where it was headed the last time I looked.  Maybe Moore has invented the ultimate lambda machine?  We might ask @oofoe ...]

[+] If the 0th arg is EOF, that becomes NIL.  (I'm not sure that I understand what I just wrote).

Revelations: kLazy is an array of False/True scriptlets (lambda functions), one for each 8-bit byte to allow lookup instead of generating scriplets on-the-fly.

The evaluator -should be- APP, but in lambda notation, APP can eval only one kind of thing - a function of 1 arg (and return a function of 1 arg), so APP does just about nothing.  Functions of 1 arg are coded up as "continuations", which are ridiculously simple because they have -exactly- 1 arg and -exactly- 1 return value.  The arg is -always- another function (i.e. a Continuation).  Where does this all stop?  In Gro.

Gro tries to suck one byte out of stdin.

If it succeeds, it creates a scriptlet (I'm still trying to understand this).

If Gro fails to get a byte from stdin (i.e. EOF), Gro creates a NIL scriptlet (λλ0).

Still pondering REFcounting.  Hypothesis: maybe a stack of depth 3 is good enough?  Maybe "the optimizer" can count up the worst-case number of items in [ ... ] and create a GC stack of that depth?  Hypothesis: GC only applies to things grouped together (e.g. in [ ... ]).  When GC is faced with only 1 thing, it needs to do nothing.  Hypothesis - maybe GC brackets can be inserted by the optimizer (see my parsing experiments (WIP post in General))).

wip: I'm working-on/thinking-about a pipeline that macro-expands `λ [[$pair $false] [[$pair $true] $nil]]` into `λ [[ λλλ0 λλ0 ] [[ λλλ0 λλ1 ] λλ0 ]]`, then parses that into executable code in various languages (Python, JS, WASM, sectorlisp, sectorblc, etc., etc.). github, discussion, here https://guitarvydas.github.io/2022/03/05/Parsing-BLC.html
