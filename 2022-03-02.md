λλλ0

λ0 is  (lambda (x) x)

λ is (lambda (f) f)

so λλλ0 is
( (lambda (f) f) ((lambda (f) f) (lambda (x) x)) )

if . means "application", then the above would be rewritten

λ.λ.λ0.

in FP notation, "application" does not have a unique character, 

"application" is implied by butting args up against functions (right to left),

hence λ0 constructs a function, but does not apply it

and λ.λ0

constructs a function (λ0) then supplies the result to another function λ

The second function is *applied* to (λ0) by butting the arg up against the function λ(λ0) right-to-left, which is the same as λλ0 (after dropping the superfluous parens).  This results in a (another) function.

and

λλλ0 is λ0 passed to λ and the result of that is passed to λ to make a 3rd function.

That 3rd function is *not* applied in λλλ0, but remains an unsatisfied function (a funciton awaiting an arg)

Only when that 3rd function is applied to arguments is a result produced.

λ0 eats one argument

λλ0 eats another argument

λλλ0 eats yet another argument,

hence, 3 arguments are required

λλλ0 a b c says 
1. create a function λλλ0
2. push arg a
3. push arg b
4. push arg c
5. apply the function (1) to the stacked args ; c is top-most, c is +0 from the top, b is +1, a is +2

how do you parse this?  
1. λ is a keyword
2. λ means "create function" & increment arg counter & remember 
3. that the next expr is the *body* of the created function
4. λλ0 means create function with body

body is either [0-9]+ or λ{body}
function-creator is λ{body}

simplifying,
body is either (1) [9-0]+ or (2) function-creator
function-creator is λ{body} & needarg+=1 (needarg might be represented as a stack of 1's, which is collapsed to give a single count when no more function-creators are found)
when there are no more λs, we parse count args and push them onto a stack from left-to-right (N.B. λs are grouped right-to-left, but args are pushed left-to-right)

Note that this is "just syntax", the Lisp version does exactly the same thing, but is "less readable" than this syntax. The machine doesn't actually care about readability, so it doesn't care if it has to crank Lisp syntax or the above syntax (Q: is the algorithm for Lisp syntax any easier?)

What is an "arg"?  It depends on the parser.  I would favour ASON args, since ASON provides a rich syntax for atomic datums.

This suggests 2 stacks - one for functions and one for args.  If we were intested in types, we could make the arg stack indirect - each arg points to a typed stack of (homogeneous) values.  E.G. an arg is a tuple {type-specifyer x index-into-space-for-that-type). (No alignment padding needed, since each type is an array of the same type of things)

Note: blc does not elide "application", but assigns the opcode "01" to this operation.

BLC assigns the opcode "00" to the operation "create function" (called "abstraction").

In BLC, *body* can only be one of three things - 
1. another 00 Abstraction
2. an application opcode 01
3. a stack ref with opcode 1...0

In BLC, what can an arg be?  I haven't sussed this out yet.

Theory: an "arg" is a bit.  Parsed as the LSB of a byte on stdin.

Q: Why does this produce 0101?
