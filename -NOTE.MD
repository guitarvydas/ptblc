I'm grinding my way through the C code.

ATM, I don't understand
- Gro, wr0, wr1
- how bytes from stdin become args to functions
- laziness
- why REF exists (I think that means reference counting).

I don't want to waste anybody's time, but, comments on these issues might help break my personal logjams.
