1.  The code in the recent blog post is fully parenthesized. I decided to invent the square bracket notation because it's isomorphic to the wire encoding. I chose square bracket because, even though the encoding is very close to the traditional notation in terms of precedence, etc. it's not exactly the same. I felt that the benefits of having a lexer/parser that could be written in a couple regex's outweighed the drawbacks of diverging from convention.

    The biggest difference is that in the traditional notation, lambda is right associative and greedy. Whereas in the binary lambda calculus encoding, your lambdas immediately terminate upon encountering the first variable -- unless -- the variable reference is enclosed in an application.
    
3.  _[_5:36 PM_]_
    
    One cool point to note is that the right square bracket `]` is entirely decorative.

This is how I understand it, I hope I'm not mistaken. I see you used JS in your blog post, so I wrote this in JS:

```
/* These are Church booleans, True returns the true "branch" if applied to both branches, False, analogously, returns the false branch. */

True  = function (x)  { return  function (y) { return x ;} }
False = function (x)  { return  function (y) { return y ;} }

/*
  If uncurried, you would write them as

  True  = function (x,y) { return x; }
  False = function (x,y) { return y; }
*/

/* Zero and Nil are just aliases for False */
Nil = False
Zero = False

/* Exit0 (λλλ0) returns a zero whatever the input is */
Exit0 = function (z) { return Zero ;}

/*
 Or, expanded:

 Exit0 = function (z) { return function (x) { return function (y) { return y;} ; } ; }

*/
```

00100101 parses to
- 00
- 10
- 0101 (remaining bytes for args, remain in stdin)

00 is Abs (aka "create function closure")
10 is arg0 (De Bruijn index - 0 is top of stack)
